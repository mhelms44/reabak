# reabak
Starting a project to help automate management of Reaper project backups. Reaper backup project settings are sane in 7.X, however this script is still nice to have this handy to keep things somewhat organized.  The current powershell script is pretty basic but overtime I plan to make it more robust and portable with more flexibility for different usecases. 

Currently the script is setup to run as a weekly scheduled task and simply checks if a directory I configured in Reaper to automatically save backup project files is empty or not. If it is not empty it calls robocopy to move them all off to a larger capacity mechanical drive for longer term storage. Flash may be cheap but that doesn't mean I want to bloat my SSD space with 10s of 100s of gigs worth of backup project files. I also don't want to ever be stuck waiting for an automatic save to complete waiting for an HDD to spin up, or network latency for a NAS, etc.
